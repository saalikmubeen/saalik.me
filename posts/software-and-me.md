`console.log("Hello World!");`

I am a self taught Fullstack Software Developer; though I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering but curiosity to learn something know no bounds, not having a CSE or IT degree didn't stop me from following my curiosity and intuition and learning software engineering. I like software engineering _(it's not that I'm obsessed)_, creating software, and learn different tech stacks, languages and technologies especially the **JavaScript** and **React** ecosystem. I know, I know some people don't like javascript due it's quirks, but I like it, comes pretty naturally.

_I find satisfaction and contentment in learning and seeking knowledge. I have become kinda addicted to learning new technologies and feel bad if I don't learn something new and better myself._

I am well versed with wide range of burning technologies like MongoDB, Python, JavaScript, React, Express.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, AWS and more. But I am more inclined towards the **Fullstack JavaScript** and I love **React** among all the technologies and frameworks. Working for a cause, creating world revolutionizing softwares and technologies, learning, teaching, bringing value to people, helping others, anything that makes a world a better place _(and yes earning a lot of money)_ that's something that motivates me I and want to do.


### Technologies, frameworks and languages I work with:

- **Frontend:**
  HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Typescript, SASS, React, Redux, Next.js, Gatsby, Apollo Client
- **Backend:**

  django-rest-framework, graphene-django
- **Databases:**
