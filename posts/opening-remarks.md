Half of August has passed and nothing changed.
For all I can really do now is stand and wait here for September's rain to wash me and make me anew.
And if that doesn't work ,
I'll wait for October, I'll light a spirit boat and say my goodbyes to the old me and old memories.
If that doesn't work,
Dear November,
I surely hope you'll be kind and show me my way.
But if not,
At the beginning of December, I'll count down for the New Year and cross my fingers.
