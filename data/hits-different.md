### Thank me later :)

**_Lyrics:_**

I washed my hands of us
At the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls
In love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus
That never shows
You just start walking on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy
For me to do
It hits different, it hits
Different 'cause it's you

I used to switch out these Kens
I'd just ghost
Rip the band aid off and skip town
Like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then
On the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and
The sand hurts my feelings

And I never don't cry at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious
I slur your name til someone puts
Me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy
For me to do
It hits different, it hits
Different 'cause it's you

I find the artifacts
Cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence
Make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleeding
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor it's
Simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease
By your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off
The main guy
Dreams of your hair and your
Stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once
Believed in me
And I felt you and I held you
For a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical
Dream girl
I heard your key turn in the door
Down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay?
Is it you?
Or have they come to
Take me away?

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
Cause it's you
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy
For me to do
It hits different, it hits
Different 'cause it's you
